## Find the pair

This project contains a game 'find the pair'.

### Getting started

To start the project you will need npm.

You will find instructions for installing npm here: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

Then run your CLI, _cd_ to your projects folder and use commands:
 
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:kkdshka/find-the-pair.git

$ cd find-the-pair/

$ npm install

$ npm install --save-dev babel-loader babel-core babel-preset-es2015 webpack

$ webpack

```

Then find _index.html_ file and run it in your browser.

### Issues

Now I did not find out why _npm install_ does not install _babel-loader_.

Also choosing field size and animation does not work.
